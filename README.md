# Here Lies My Work

Right now this repo only contains the Powershell scripts that I've written for supporting Azure Microsoft Virtual Desktop(Fall 2019). They take care of things that I found myself constantly having to do in my day-to-day. I hope someone else can find them helpful. 

This will be a continual work in progress as I learn the ways of Git and Github among other things like Python, Ansible, etc. I will continue to add more of the scripts I've created as I can get the time to sanitize them for public consumption. 

From this seed, I build my crop, as it were.
