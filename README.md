# Here Lies My Work

### Update

I've since added some terraform modules that I've created in my new role. I plan to add on to this as I keep building them.


This repo contains the Powershell scripts that I've written for supporting Azure Microsoft Windows Virtual Desktop Fall 2019(classic) and Spring 2020(arm integrated). They take care of things that I found myself constantly having to do in my day-to-day. I hope someone else can find them helpful. 

This will be a continual work in progress as I learn the ways of Git and Github among other things like Python, Ansible, etc. I will continue to add more of the scripts I've created as I can get the time to sanitize them for public consumption. 

From this seed, I build my crop, as it were.
